Java-Tic-Tac-Toe-AI
===================

Example of basic minimax algorithm on Tic-Tac-Toe. Computer always wins or draws.
Written in Java using NetBeans 7.4
This has been translated from a functional version I wrote in C++ for a class.
It was just meant as an exercise to help me get used to Java again, since I hadn't used it for a while.
